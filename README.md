# Example plotting a chart using Rust and Plotters

This project shows an example of how to plot a candlesticks plot/chart. It also shows how to add multiple Simple Moving Average (SMA) lines to it. Then save it as an image.

I have a tutorial on my blog explaining the details of this project: (Plot Candles and SMA with Rust: learn how to)[https://tms-dev-blog.com/plot-candles-sma-using-rust-and-plotters].

## Running the project

The project does not need any additional configuration or external sources. All it needs it the presence of a dir called "plots-output" in the root of the project.

Then run with `cargo run --release`.
